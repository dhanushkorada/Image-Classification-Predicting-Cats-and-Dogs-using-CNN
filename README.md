- `dataset/`: Directory containing the training and test image datasets.
  - `training_set/`: Directory containing the training images.
  - `test_set/`: Directory containing the test images.
  - `single_prediction/`: Directory containing images for single predictions.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Getting Started
